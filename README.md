# Pixel Territory - Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## 1. Core Game Infrastructure

### Grid System Development
- Implement a 20Ã—20 grid (400 cells) using JSON data structure
- Each cell should store: owner ID, color, capture timestamp, and power level
- Create functions to initialize, update, and read the grid state
- Implement boundary checking and validation mechanisms

### Data Persistence Layer
- Set up Redis for efficient game state storage and retrieval
- Create data models for grid state, player information, and game configuration
- Implement automatic daily state archiving for historical records
- Design efficient update patterns to minimize storage requirements

### Game State Management
- Develop state transition logic for territory claiming and conflicts
- Implement power calculation based on time and territory size
- Create territory validation rules (adjacency requirements, power thresholds)
- Build system for daily resets using Devvit's scheduler (midnight UTC)

## 2. Game Mechanics Implementation

### Territory Control System
- New players can claim any unclaimed cell
- Existing players can only expand to adjacent cells (orthogonal movement)
- Claiming an opponent's cell requires more power than they currently have in that cell
- Power accumulates over time for each territory

### Alliance Mechanics
- Create alliance formation through comment-based commands
- Implement protected territories between allied players
- Design combined scoring for alliance members
- Build invitation and acceptance workflow

### Power-up System
- Implement daily random power-up cell generation
- Create different power-up types with unique effects:
  - Shield: Temporary protection for a territory
  - Bomb: Multi-cell claiming ability
  - Teleport: Non-adjacent territory claiming
  - Color Bomb: Convert adjacent enemy territories

### Token Economy
- Implement 10-token requirement for territory claims
- Create riddle/question system for earning tokens
- Develop token accumulation and spending mechanics
- Track token balances and transaction history

## 3. User Interface Design

### Grid Visualization
- Design responsive CSS grid or canvas element for territory display
- Implement color coding for different players' territories
- Create hover states to show cell information
- Build visual feedback for claim attempts (success/failure)

### Player Dashboard
- Design territory statistics panel
- Create leaderboard showing top players and territory sizes
- Implement personal stats tracking
- Build alliance management interface

### Interactive Elements
- Implement click/tap interface for cell selection
- Create confirmation dialogs for important actions
- Design visual indicators for valid expansion options
- Build power-up selection and activation interface

## 4. Community Features

### Subreddit Representation
- Create unique color/pattern generation for subreddits
- Implement subreddit-based team formation
- Track and display subreddit territory statistics
- Design subreddit icon/pattern display on territories

### Karma Integration
- Implement karma-based power modifiers
- Create different bonuses for post vs. comment karma
- Design special abilities for high-karma users
- Build karma tracking and bonus calculation

### Award System
- Create integration with Reddit Awards
- Implement award-based territory boosts
- Design visual indicators for award-enhanced territories
- Track award effects and durations

## 5. Engagement Features

### Daily Challenges
- Implement rotating objective system
- Create themed days with special rules
- Design achievement badge system
- Build challenge progress tracking

### Leaderboards
- Implement daily top territory owners tracking
- Create weekly champions recognition
- Design special awards ("Most Aggressive", "Survivor")
- Build historical performance tracking

### History Visualization
- Create time-lapse replay functionality
- Implement heat maps for contested areas
- Design player activity pattern analytics
- Build historical data browsing interface

## 6. Reddit-Specific Features

### Flair Wars
- Implement Reddit flair display on territories
- Create flair-based grouping for special events
- Design flair alliance mechanics
- Build flair recognition and validation

### Meme Integration
- Create system for meme-enhanced territories
- Implement "Meme of the day" contest mechanics
- Design meme-based bonus calculations
- Build meme reference validation

### Community Lore
- Create territory naming and backstory system
- Implement weekly lore contests
- Design lore display on territory hover
- Build comment integration for lore submissions

## 7. Technical Optimizations

### Performance Enhancements
- Implement debouncing for rapid cell claims
- Create selective grid updating (only changed parts)
- Design efficient rendering techniques
- Build caching for frequently accessed data

### Scaling Considerations
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Create load balancing for high-traffic periods
- Design database optimization for rapid updates
- Build resource management for server constraints

## 8. Testing & Deployment
