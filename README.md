# Pixel Territory - Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## 1. Core Game Infrastructure

### Grid System Development

- Implement a 20Ã—20 grid (400 cells) using JSON data structure
- Each cell should store: owner ID, color, capture timestamp, and power level
- Create functions to initialize, update, and read the grid state
- Implement boundary checking and validation mechanisms

### Data Persistence Layer

- Set up Redis for efficient game state storage and retrieval
- Create data models for grid state, player information, and game configuration
- Implement automatic daily state archiving for historical records
- Design efficient update patterns to minimize storage requirements

### Game State Management

- Develop state transition logic for territory claiming and conflicts
- Implement power calculation based on time and territory size
- Create territory validation rules (adjacency requirements, power thresholds)
- Build system for daily resets using Devvit's scheduler (midnight UTC)

## 2. Game Mechanics Implementation

### Territory Control System

- New players can claim any unclaimed cell
- Existing players can only expand to adjacent cells (orthogonal movement)
- Claiming an opponent's cell requires more power than they currently have in that cell
- Power accumulates over time for each territory

### Alliance Mechanics

- Create alliance formation through comment-based commands
- Implement protected territories between allied players
- Design combined scoring for alliance members
- Build invitation and acceptance workflow

### Power-up System

- Implement daily random power-up cell generation
- Create different power-up types with unique effects:
  - Shield: Temporary protection for a territory
  - Bomb: Multi-cell claiming ability
  - Teleport: Non-adjacent territory claiming
  - Color Bomb: Convert adjacent enemy territories

### Token Economy

- Implement 10-token requirement for territory claims
- Create riddle/question system for earning tokens
- Develop token accumulation and spending mechanics
- Track token balances and transaction history

## 3. User Interface Design

### Grid Visualization

- Design responsive CSS grid for territory display
  - Implement 20x20 grid layout with automatic sizing based on viewport
  - Use CSS Grid with minmax() for responsive cell sizing
  - Add media queries to optimize for mobile/desktop viewing
- Implement color coding for different players' territories
  - Generate unique colors based on player ID using HSL color space
  - Add visual patterns/textures for colorblind accessibility
  - Implement brightness adjustments based on territory power
- Create hover states to show cell information
  - Display tooltips with owner, capture time, and power level
  - Show potential action outcomes (claim success probability)
  - Highlight valid adjacent cells for expansion
- Build visual feedback for claim attempts (success/failure)
  - Add animations for successful territory captures
  - Implement brief flash effects for failed attempts
  - Create pulsing effect for newly acquired territories

### Player Dashboard

- Design territory statistics panel

  - Implement sortable leaderboard by territory count or power
  - Highlight current player in the standings
  - Display color-coded player identifiers for visual recognition
  - Auto-refresh when territory changes occur
- Implement personal stats tracking
  - Track historical data: territories gained/lost over time
  - Record player activity and participation metrics
  - Visualize statistics for player performance insights
  - Store persistent stats between sessions
- Build alliance management interface
  - Create alliance formation request system
  - Display active alliances and their combined statistics
  - Implement alliance breaking functionality
  - Visualize alliance relationships and benefits

### Interactive Elements

- Implement click/tap interface for cell selection
  - Highlight selected cells with distinctive visual indicators
  - Allow selection of only player-owned territories

  - Show power comparison for attack attempts
  - Display token costs for claiming territories
  - Include confirm/cancel options with clear visual distinction
  - Implement programmatic dialog creation for flexible messaging
- Design visual indicators for valid expansion options
  - Highlight adjacent cells available for expansion
  - Show pulsing effect to draw attention to valid moves
  - Color-code based on likelihood of successful capture
  - Update indicators in real-time as game state changes
- Build power-up selection and activation interface
  - Create visual power-up cards with icons and descriptions
